# Goss test specification for Nginx Unit

# Essentially, we would get away with just testing if we get a proper response from the given URL,
# but having more fine grained tests can help us pinpoint the source of the problem faster.

# Check that the asset html file exists and has the correct size
file:
  /www/data/index.html:
    exists: true
    size: 122

# Check that the Nginx Unit service is running
process:
  unitd:
    running: true

# Check that something is listening on port 8080
port:
  tcp:8080:
    listening: true

# Check that we get the correct response from a given URL
http:
  http://localhost:8080/index.html:
    status: 200
    body: [ "Hello from Nginx Unit!", "Yes, Hello indeed." ]

# This test verifies the correct Unit version for the image installed from Yum.addr:
# WARNING: This test makes a dangerous assumption about the version number available from Yum
# which is at the time of the writing 1.34.2. So the test will eventually stop working.
command:
  'version-check':
    exit-status: 0
    exec: "unitd --version"
    stderr:
      - "unit version: 1.34.2"
